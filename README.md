### Inject dv metadata of hevc video for macOS

#### This script will extract dolby vision metadata from a hevc .mkv/.mp4 video,
#### copy another hevc .mkv video with same dv profile but no dv metadata
#### and then output the video having those metadata injected.

##### Argument1: full path of source video 1 (.mkv/.mp4). Its dv metadata would be extracted [Optional]
##### Argument2: full path of source video 2 (.mkv/.mp4). Its video and audio would be copied [Optional]
##### Argument3: full path of output(work) folder [Optional]


#### How Use :
` Run the command script directly. It will request your input for`
` both the path of video with dv metadata and`
` the path of source video which its content will be copied and`
` the copied video will be injected with dv metadata.`

#### Download :
```
cd ~/Desktop && git clone https://github.com/alpha-0/inject-hevc-dv-metadata.git && \
